Self-Review
- There are obviously things that I need to work at but I think I need to mainly work on the basics.
- I have been using ChatGPT to explain alot of the concepts and it has been really helpful at helping me process some of the basic stuff.
- In terms of coding, I do believe I do a good job at coding any loops.
- I did figure out how to correctly use GitHub, so I won't have to worry about running into problems there.
