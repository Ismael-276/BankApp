 GBU
 - This assignment wasn't very difficult and was very informational. 
 - I enjoyed that I am able to generate setters and getters along with javadocs as it saves alot of time.
 - I also enjoyed coding the validation for the setters and the balance and withdrawal methods.
 - I don't think there was anything that went wrong with this assignment other than GitHub not letting me push my commits. 
 - None of the new concepts that we implemented were hard to process, so I didn't run into anything that held me up.
